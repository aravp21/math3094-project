## Heart Failure Prediction

Contributors: Arav Parikh, Dheeraj Banala, Akshay Zaveri

Performed basic statistical analysis on UCI heart failure dataset before cleaning the data and proceeding to model it with various popular machine learning algorithms as a way of demonstrating industry best practices and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms behind these algorithms. Uncovered that the most important features in predicting mortality were age, time spent in observation, creatinine phosphokinase levels, and heart ejection fraction, all of which were deemed relevant by the research paper that published the dataset as well. Also discovered that many models can predict heart failure deaths reasonably effectively, but the best approaches involved either a simple neural network or logistic regression approach. Difficult to generalize results in the end, though, as the dataset was very limited in terms of its size and biased towards negative outcome (i.e. patient survival).
